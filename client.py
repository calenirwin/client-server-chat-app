    # We use the following functions contained within the Struct module:
    # pack() - Returns a bytes object according to the format string
    # unpack() - Unpack the buffer according to the format string into a tuple
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Format String Description
    # ! = byte-ordering

    #     proceeding it minus 1 (e.g. 21p is a string of maximum 20 characters)
